## Description

This is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project created for the sole purpose of demonstrating learning about typescript and the basics of how to use some of its main features.

<br />

## Features

The project has an index.html which is where I started and only adds between 2 numbers. This was not the focus here, but explaining and showing in a basic way how to use:
- classes
- generics
- types
- interfaces
- difference between type and interface
- some utilities like Partial, Omit and Pick.

The project was created using 2 terminals, one to allow compilation of the typescript to check and correct errors and another to run nodemon and check the return of each of these files, for example:

```bash
tsc --watch
# and
nodemon ./dist/decorators.js
```

<br />

## Prerequisites

Have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed on the machine and the global version of **TypeScript** (npm install -g typescript) and **Nodemon** (npm install -g nodemon).

<br />

## Technologies

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
